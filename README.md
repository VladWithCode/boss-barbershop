## Small webapp for a Barbershop "The Boss"

The barbershop The Boss contacted us to make a webapp where their
customers could make apointments online, with the requirement of a
fraction of the price for the service as a quota for the reservation.

This site was made with Next.js, which may seem a bit overkill, but
we're planning on expanding the project to suit the seemingly increasing
need the barbershop has.

### Listing of the tools used to develop this site

-   Next.js
-   Tailwindcss
-   Framer-motion (For animations)
-   Typescript
